 If bid wars are consistently ending near your price ceiling, definitely enable this

[19:40:08] Use this to avoid needless bid wars. 
 If bid wars are consistently ending near your price ceiling, definitely enable this 
 (you're probably fighting another autobidder and should choose a new player) 
 This also avoids a soft ban, if you make over a certain number of bids in a day
